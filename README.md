*   **Pomodoro Timer:** A built-in Pomodoro timer to help you stay focused.
*   **To-Do List:** Manage your tasks directly from your status bar.
*   **Themes Responsive:** can easily change style based on omarchy current theme but it looks great in light theme.

## Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Waybar:** The main status bar application.
*   **waybar-timer:** For the Pomodoro timer functionality. You can find it at [https://github.com/nirabyte/waybar-timer](https://github.com/nirabyte/waybar-timer).
*   **Python:** For the to-do list script and other scripts(which i put as todo-scripts in root).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaidev7823/wayland-conf.git
    cd wayland-conf
    ```

2.  **Option 1: Replace your current Waybar configuration repository:**
    - Backup your existing Waybar config directory.
    - Replace your current Waybar folder with the one from this repository.
    - Restart Waybar.

    This is the fastest way to get the full configuration exactly as intended.

3.  **Option 2: Pick what you like and merge manually:**
    - Browse the repository and select specific modules, styles, or scripts.
    - Copy only the parts you want into your existing Waybar configuration.
    - Adjust paths and module names as needed to fit your setup.

This approach is recommended if you already have a customized Waybar setup.
